**Design Tips for Promotional Images**:
- Keep text minimal

- Make sure the image works when shrunk to half size
- Avoid claims like "Editor's Choice" or "Number One"

## Additional Information

- **Single Purpose Description** (1,000 chars max):
  ```
  This extension connects ChatGPT to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, allowing users to use custom AI tools directly within ChatGPT conversations. It extends ChatGPT's capabilities by integrating external tools without leaving the chat interface.
  ```

- **Website/Homepage URL**: Your project's GitHub page or documentation site
  - Builds trust with users
  - Provides more information about your extension

## Permission Justifications

Clear permission justifications help your extension get approved faster:

- **Host Permission Justification**:
  ```
  This extension requires host permissions to communicate with user-configured MCP servers (via *://*/*) and to intercept and modify requests to OpenAI's API (via https://api.openai.com/*) in order to register tools with ChatGPT and handle tool execution requests.
  ```

- **Remote Code Justification** (if "Yes, I am using remote code" is selected):
  ```
  The extension connects to user-configured MCP servers to discover and execute tools. These servers provide tool definitions and handle tool execution requests. The extension does not execute arbitrary code from these servers but rather processes structured tool definitions and executes tools through a sandboxed API.
  ```
