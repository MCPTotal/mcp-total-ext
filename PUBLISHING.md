```

This summary:
- Clearly explains what the extension does
- Highlights the main user benefit (extending ChatGPT)
- Avoids generic claims like "best extension ever"

### Item Description (16,000 characters max)

Format your description with:

```
MCPTotal Extension seamlessly integrates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with the ChatGPT interface, allowing you to extend ChatGPT with custom AI tools and capabilities.

‚ú® WHAT IT DOES
This extension lets you connect ChatGPT to any MCP-compatible tools and services. Once connected, ChatGPT can use these tools directly in your conversations, enabling you to build and use custom AI capabilities beyond ChatGPT's built-in features.

üîë KEY FEATURES
‚Ä¢ Seamlessly integrate tools from MCP servers into ChatGPT
‚Ä¢ Review and edit tool responses before they're sent to ChatGPT
‚Ä¢ Configure SSE-based MCP servers with a simple keyboard shortcut (<Ctrl>+M)
  ‚Ä¢ Stdio-based MCP servers could be adapted using mcp-proxy (https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy)
‚Ä¢ Ability to configure auto-run and auto-send modes

‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT LIMITATIONS
‚Ä¢ Only tools are supported: Currently, only tool functionality is supported. Future versions will add support for other MCP features
‚Ä¢ Limited number of tools: Due to ChatGPT's customization system prompt limitations, only a limited number of tools can be registered at once

üîí PRIVACY & SECURITY
‚Ä¢ Your conversations stay private ‚Äì we don't collect chat data
‚Ä¢ Servers configurations are stored locally in your browser
‚Ä¢ Only tool call parameters are sent to your configured MCP servers
‚Ä¢ Minimal permissions required

‚öôÔ∏è GETTING STARTED
1. Install the extension
2. Visit chatgpt.com
3. Connect to an MCP server by opening the configuration UI (Ctrl+M)
4. Start using MCP tools in your ChatGPT conversations

üì± CONNECT TO POPULAR SERVICES
You can use WhatsApp directly from ChatGPT with the whatsapp-mcp server:
1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp
2. Run the bridge (cd bridge && go run main.go) and scan the QR code
3. Run the MCP server with proxy: cd whatsapp-mcp-server && uvx mcp-proxy --sse-port=8090 uv run main.py
4. Connect the extension to http://localhost:8090/sse

‚ÑπÔ∏è HOW IT WORKS
The extension uses ChatGPT's customization feature (system prompt) to register MCP tools, which allows the AI to call these tools during conversations. Tool calls are handled by the extension and results are sent back to ChatGPT.

This extension is not affiliated with OpenAI or ChatGPT.
