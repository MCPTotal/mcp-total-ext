# Privacy Policy for MCP Total Extension

**Last Updated: April 30, 2025**

## Overview

MCP Total Extension ("the Extension") is a browser extension that helps users connect ChatGPT to their own backend tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This Privacy Policy explains what information is used by the Extension and how it is handled.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Collect

The Extension stores the following information **locally in your browser**:

- **MCP server configurations**, including server URLs and API keys, provided by you.

When you manually trigger a tool, the necessary parameters for that specific tool call are sent directly to the MCP server you configured. These parameters are **not stored** by the Extension.

### What We Do Not Collect

The Extension does **not**:

- Collect or transmit your ChatGPT conversations
- Collect personally identifiable information
- Transmit any data to the developers or any third parties by default

Data is only sent to MCP servers **you explicitly added**  and **only when you triggered a tool call**.

## Data Storage

All configuration data is stored locally in your browser. It never leaves your device except when interacting with an MCP server that you have configured.

## Data Sharing

The Extension does not share data with third parties except:

- **Your configured MCP servers**, which receive only the tool-specific parameters when you initiate a tool call
- **ChatGPT** receives the response from the MCP server, if you choose to.

## Security

We apply reasonable security practices for local storage. However, communication with MCP servers occurs over the network and is subject to the security of those servers.

## Your Control

You have full control over your data:

- View or delete MCP configurations anytime via the Extension interface
- Remove the Extension to fully clear all stored data

## Third-Party Services

The Extension connects only to MCP servers that you explicitly configure. We do not control or monitor those services and encourage you to review their privacy practices.

## Children's Privacy

This Extension is not intended for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them.

## Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this policy will be posted here, with the updated "Last Updated" date.
